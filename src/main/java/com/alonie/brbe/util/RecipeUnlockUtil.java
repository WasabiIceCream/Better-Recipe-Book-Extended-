/**
 * Drives the "unlock all recipes" toggle purely client-side.
 *
 * <p>Design: mark-then-filter.  Unlock-all does NOT mutate the server book;
 * it records every display <b>it actually added</b> in
 * {@link #unlockAllInjected} and adds the display to the local
 * {@link ClientRecipeBook}.  Turning the toggle off removes exactly those
 * marked displays ({@link #revokeUnlockAll}) — never the server-synced
 * recipes, which are identified by non-negative display index (the server only
 * sends non-negative indices; BRBE's vanilla-cache injections are negative, see
 * {@link VanillaRecipeCache#isLocalRecipe}).  Because the marker set and the
 * known map are both in memory, toggling applies immediately
 * (rebuildCollections → engine rebuild), no world reload needed.
 *
 * <p>Displays that were already in the book when unlock-all ran (server
 * progression, or another mod that unlocks everything — e.g. the
 * {@code get-recipes} mod's client-side injector) are <b>not</b> marked and are
 * left untouched when the toggle turns off: they are not BRBE's doing.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #isBrbeImported} is the same mark-then-filter pattern as the
 * workstation {@code recipeBook} flag: it distinguishes the BRBE-imported half
 * of the known set (unlock-all injections plus negative-index cache entries)
 * from the server-unlocked half, so a config toggle can hide the imported
 * recipes up front.
